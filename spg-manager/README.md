# SPG Manager
This kernel module in essence runs SpecProbeGuard, managing the different phases of its operation. Once the kernel has been compiled with support for SpecProbeGuard, one activates the defence by loading this kernel module.

Full documentation on how the defence works, what its different phases entail, and more, can be found in the spg_manager.c file. Our paper further expands on our design and design choices.
